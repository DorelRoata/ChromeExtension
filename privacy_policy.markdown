# Privacy Policy for Advantage Multi-Vendor Price Scraper

**Effective Date**: October 7, 2024

## Introduction
Advantage Multi-Vendor Price Scraper ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension designed to scrape pricing data from supported vendor websites (Grainger, McMaster-Carr, Festo, and Zoro) and send it to a user-controlled local server for processing. This Privacy Policy outlines how the Extension handles data, including collection, use, and sharing practices.

## Data Collection
The Extension collects the following data when you use it on supported vendor websites:
- **Product Information**: Part number, description, price, unit, manufacturer number, brand, URL of the product page, and timestamp.
- **Tab Information**: Tab ID and URL of the webpage being scraped to manage scraping sessions.
- **No Personal Data**: The Extension does not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or payment details) unless explicitly provided by you in the scraped data (which is not expected or required).

## Data Usage
- **Purpose**: Collected data is used solely to extract pricing and product details from supported vendor websites and send them to a local server running on your device (`http://localhost:5000`) for further processing.
- **Local Processing**: All data is sent to your local server, which you control. The Extension does not transmit data to external servers or third parties unless explicitly configured by you.
- **Temporary Storage**: Data is temporarily held in memory during scraping and transmission to the local server. No persistent storage occurs within the Extension itself.

## Data Sharing
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: The Extension does not share data with third parties, including the developer or external services, unless you configure the local server to do so.
- **Local Server**: Data is sent to your local server (`http://localhost:5000`). You are responsible for securing this server and any subsequent data handling.
- **Browser APIs**: The Extension uses Chrome APIs (e.g., `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.tabs`) to manage tabs and communicate with the local server, but no data is sent to Google or other entities via these APIs.

## Data Security
- **Transmission**: Data is sent to your local server using HTTP POST requests. As the server runs locally (`http://localhost`), it is not exposed to external networks unless you configure otherwise.
- **No Cloud Storage**: The Extension does not store data in the cloud or on external servers.
- **Your Responsibility**: You are responsible for securing your local server and ensuring it uses appropriate security measures (e.g., HTTPS if extended beyond localhost).

## User Control
- **Access**: You can review the scraped data by inspecting the requests sent to your local server.
- **Deletion**: Since data is not stored by the Extension, deletion is managed by your local server. You can stop the server or clear its data to remove collected information.
- **Opt-Out**: To stop data collection, uninstall the Extension or refrain from using it on supported vendor websites.

## Cookies and Tracking
- The Extension does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics services.
- It only accesses the content of supported vendor webpages to extract product details.

## Compliance with Chrome Web Store Policies
This Extension complies with Chrome Web Store policies by:
- Clearly disclosing data collection and usage practices.
- Limiting data collection to what is necessary for functionality.
- Not sharing data with third parties without user consent.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the Extensionâ€™s functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be reflected in the hosted policy document, and you are encouraged to review it periodically.
